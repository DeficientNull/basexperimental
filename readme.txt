Mayhem
======

This is Mayhem. A collaboration of Nuclide and LibreQuake.

This sample game is yours to take apart. We ensured that
every single resource here is yours for the taking.
In all cases only attribution is required.

Gameplay is loosely based upon LQ, but intended to highlight
the various enhancements that can be easily taken advantage
of in Nuclide.

Generally, everything you see can be edited outside the
source code.

Try a couple game modes in multiplayer. Or attempt to play
a chapter in singleplayer.

Most importantly, build something for you to share with
others, much like we have done.
