This file exists to clear confusion on the texture folders, sepcifically the naming convention i'm using

over time this project will use many licensed assets as i want to freely experiment with different kinds of maps and aesthetics but since this is an open source project the licenses of some of these assets may not be permissive to say, be used elsewhere in a commercial fashion. This folder structure (from /null/ and beyond) is meant to clarify that.

As is there are three major folders

- licensed_permissive: AKA stuff from textures.com or other free asset sites that has a pretty permissive license and therefore can be used in commercial projects with no caveats

- kingpin: An example game whose assets should not be used directly in a commercial title

- hl: Half-life 1/2 Assets, same idea as the kingpin folder

- Unknown: Textures that do not have any known license attached to them
